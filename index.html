								<p class="about-text">Hi, my name is Michael Guillen        and I just graduated from University of Texas at        Austin. I recieved a government degree in the           Liberal Arts College, with a Business Foundations       Certificate and a Spanish minor. I was one of the       founding fathers of the Delta Upsilon fraternity on     campus, 
                                    with our focus being based around diversity, justice, and service. I also was involved
                                    in several other organizations such as Students for Bernie Sanders, Campus Events and 
                                    Entertainment, and University Democrats. Last summer, I interned for The Austin School
                                    for the Visual and Performing Arts as the Non-profit Manager. Finally, i'm finishing up 
                                    my post-graduate education with a certificate from the University of Texas at Austin
                                    Web Development Bootcamp.

								<p class="about-text">On the personal side of things, I'm originally from Temple, TX, a small town just an hour 
                                    north of Austin. I am passionate about several things, all things I hope to make some sort
                                    of impact in eventually with my abilities and education. I love basketball, both playing and 
                                    watching. Music, especially hip-hop/rap, is the thing that gives me energy throughout the day.
                                    I've always had a passion for theatre arts and film, and hope to bring that to underprivilaged 
                                    kids eventually in my life. Finally, fashion has always been an important aspect to me as well, 
                                    and I believe it's an important way to express oneself. I would eventually like to design my own
                                    clothing and find a way for underprivlaged kids to have more access to affordable clothes
                                    that they would like to wear.
